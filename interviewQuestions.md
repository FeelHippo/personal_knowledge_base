<!-- WHAT IS REST -->

## What is REST

**REST** is an acronym for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer and an architectural **style** for distributed hypermedia systems.

**REST is not a protocol or a standard**, it is an architectural style. During the development phase, API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.

A Web API (or Web Service) conforming to the REST architectural style is called a REST API (or RESTful API).

REST is based on some constraints and principles that promote simplicity, scalability, and statelessness in the design. There are six guiding principles:

The key **abstraction of information** in REST is a **resource**. Any information that we can name can be a resource. For example, a REST resource can be a document or image, a temporal service, a collection of other resources, or a non-virtual object (e.g., a person).

The state of the resource, at any particular time, is known as the **resource representation**. The resource representations consist of:

- the **data**
- the **metadata** describing the data
- and the **hypermedia links** that can help the clients transition to the next desired state.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- UNIFORM INTERFACE -->

### Uniform Interface

REST defines a consistent and uniform interface for interactions between clients and servers. 

For example, the HTTP-based REST APIs make use of the standard HTTP methods (**GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**, etc.) and the URIs (**Uniform Resource Identifiers**) to **uniquely** identify resources.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- CLIENT SERVER -->

### Client Server

The client-server design pattern enforces the separation of concerns, which helps the client and the server components evolve independently.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- STATELESS -->

### Stateless

Statelessness mandates that each request from the client to the server must contain all of the information necessary to understand and complete the request.

The server cannot take advantage of any previously stored context information on the server.

For this reason, the client application must entirely keep the session state.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- CACHEABLE -->

### Cacheable

The cacheable constraint requires that a response should implicitly or explicitly label itself as cacheable or non-cacheable.

If the response is cacheable, the client application gets the right to reuse the response data later for equivalent requests and a specified period.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- LAYERED SYSTEM -->

### Layered System

In a layered system, each component cannot see beyond the immediate layer they are interacting with.

A layman’s example of a layered system is the [MVC pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC). The MVC pattern allows for a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale the application.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- CODE ON DEMAND -->

### Code on Demand (Optional)

REST also allows client functionality to extend by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- WHAT IS ACID -->

## What is ACID

ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a **set of properties of database transactions** intended to **guarantee data validity** despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. 

In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ATOMICITY -->

### Atomicity

Transactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that **each transaction is treated as a single "unit"**, which either succeeds completely or fails completely: if **any** of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the **entire transaction fails** and the database is left unchanged.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- CONSISTENCY -->

### Consistency

Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database **from one consistent state to another**, and any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ISOLATION -->

### Isolation

Transactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). Isolation ensures that **concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially**.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- DURABILITY -->

### Durability

Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will **remain committed even in the case of a system failure**.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- DATA STRUCTURE -->

## Data Structure

A storage format that defines the way data is stored, organized, and manipulated.

Some popular data structures are Arrays, Trees, and Graphs

The amount of memory that is to be reserved or allocated depends on the data type being stored in that variable

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ARRAY -->

### Array

Is commonly referred to as a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations

Items stored are of the same type

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- LINKED LIST -->

### Linked List

Refers to a linear data structure in which the elements are not necessarily stored in a contiguous manner

It is basically a sequence of nodes, each node points towards the next node forming a chain-like structure

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- BINARY TREE -->

### Binary Tree

Is an extension of the linked list structure where each node has at most two children

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- LIFO -->

### LIFO

LIFO is an abbreviation for Last In First Out
It extracts the data that was stored last, first.

A stack refers to a linear data structure performing operations in a LIFO

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- FIFO -->

### FIFO

FIFO stands for First In First Out
The data that was stored first is extracted first

A queue refers to a linear data structure that performs operations in a FIFO order

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- BINARY SEARCH TREE -->

### Binary Search Tree

Is used to store data in a manner that it can be retrieved very efficiently. 

The left sub-tree contains nodes whose keys are less than the node’s key value.

The right sub-tree contains nodes whose keys are greater than or equal to the node’s key value

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- DOUBLY LINKED LISTS -->

### Doubly Linked Lists

Are categorized as a special type of linked list in which traversal across the data elements can be done in both directions. 

This is made possible by the presence of two links in every node, one that links to the node next to it and another that connects to the node before it.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- BASIC CONCEPTS OF IAM -->

### Basic concepts of IAM

Identity and access management provides control over user validation and resource access. Commonly known as IAM, this technology ensures that the right people access the right digital resources at the right time and for the right reasons.

- A digital resource is any combination of applications and data in a computer system.
  - web applications
  - APIs
  - platforms
  - devices
  - databases
- In IAM, a user account is a digital identity. User accounts can also represent non-humans, such as software, Internet of Things devices, or robotics
  - Authentication is the verification of a digital identity. Someone (or something) authenticates to prove that they’re the user they claim to be
  - Authorization is the process of determining what resources a user can access

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- AUTHENTICATION VS AUTHORIZATION -->

### Authentication vs Authorization

In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

|**Authentication**                                       | **Authorization**                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Determines whether users are who they claim to be        | Determines what users can and cannot access                   |
|Challenges the user to validate credentials              | Verifies whether access is allowed through policies and rules |
|Usually done before authorization                        | Usually done after successful authentication                  |
|Generally, transmits info through an ID Token            | Generally, transmits info through an Access Token             |
|Generally governed by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol | Generally governed by the OAuth 2.0 framework                 |

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- OAUTH 2 -->

### OAuth 2

- it is a [**specification**](https://oauth.net/articles/authentication/)
- defines a **delegation protocol**
  - conveys authorization decisions across a network of web-enabled applications and APIs
  - wide variety of applications, including providing mechanisms for user authentication
- **OAuth 2.0 is not an authentication protocol**
  - OAuth is used *inside* of authentication protocols
- OAuth uses tokens to grant access, which can be revoked at any time by the user, providing a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional password-based authentication
- OAuth 2 is a newer version of OAuth that simplifies the authorization process and provides better support for mobile and cloud-based applications
- Access tokens as proof of authentication:
  - Since an authentication usually occurs ahead of the issuance of an access token, it is tempting to consider reception of an access token of any type proof that such an authentication has occurred
  - However, mere possession of an access token doesn't tell the client anything on its own
  - In OAuth, the token is designed to be opaque to the client, but in the context of a user authentication, the client needs to be able to derive some information from the token
  - This problem stems from the fact that the client is not the intended *audience* of the OAuth access token. Instead, it is the *authorized presenter* of that token, and the audience is in fact the *protected resource*
- general OAuth does **not** define a specific format or structure for the access token itself
  - protocols like OpenID Connect's ID Token and Facebook Connect's Signed Response provide a secondary token along side the access token that communicates the authentication information directly to the client
  - This allows the primary access token to remain opaque to the client, just like in regular OAuth
- Access of a protected API as proof of authentication:
  - the token was freshly minted in the context of a user being authenticated at the authorization server, or
  - Refresh tokens and assertions can be used to get access tokens without the user being present, or
  - in some cases access grants can occur without the user having to authenticate at all

<!-- OPEN ID CONNECT -->

### Open ID Connect

- [how it works](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)
  - *It simplifies the way to verify the identity of users based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server and to obtain user profile information in an interoperable and REST-like manner.*
  - *OpenID Connect enables application and website developers to launch sign-in flows and receive verifiable assertions about users across Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients*
- an open standard published in early 2014 that defines an **interoperable way to use OAuth 2.0 to perform user authentication**
- built directly on OAuth 2.0 and in most cases is deployed right along with (or on top of) an OAuth infrastructure
- uses the JSON Object Signing And Encryption (JOSE) suite of specifications for carrying signed and encrypted information around in different places
  - an OAuth 2.0 deployment with JOSE capabilities is already a long way to defining a fully compliant OpenID Connect system
  - the delta between the two is relatively small
  - that delta makes a big difference, and OpenID Connect manages to avoid many of the pitfalls discussed above by adding **several key components** to the OAuth base:
    - [**ID Tokens**](https://jwt.io/introduction)
      - The OpenID Connect ID Token is a **signed JSON Web Token (JWT)** that is given to the client application along side the regular OAuth access token
      - The ID Token contains a set of claims about the authentication session:
        - *identifier for the user (sub)*
        - *identifier for the identity provider who issued the token (iss)*
        - *the identifier of the client for which this token was created (aud)*
        - information about the token's valid (and usually short) *lifetime*
        - it is issued in addition to (and not in lieu of) an access token, allowing the access token to remain *opaque* to the client as it is defined in regular OAuth
    - UserInfo Endpoint
      - clients are not *required* to use the **access token**, since the **ID Token** contains all the necessary information for *processing the authentication event*. However, in order to provide *compatibility with OAuth* and *match the general tendency* for authorizing identity and other API access in parallel, **OpenID Connect always issues the ID token along side an OAuth access token**.
      - In addition to the claims in the ID Token, **OpenID Connect defines a standard protected resource** that contains claims about the **current user**
      - The claims here are **not part of the authentication process**, as discussed above, but instead provide **bundled identity attributes** that make the authentication protocol more valuable to application developers
      - OpenID Connect defines a set of standardized OAuth scopes that map to subsets of these attributes:
        - *profile*
        - *email*
        - *phone*
        - *address*
    - Dynamic server discovery and client registration
      - With OpenID Connect, a common protected API is deployed across a wide variety of clients and providers, all of which need to know about each other to operate
      - OpenID Connect defines a **discovery protocol** that allows clients to easily **fetch information on how to interact with a specific identity provider**
      - On the other side of the transaction, OpenID Connect defines a **client registration protocol** that allows **clients to be introduced to new identity providers**
      - By using these two mechanisms and a common identity API, OpenID Connect can function at internet scale, where no parties have to know about each other ahead of time
    - Compatibility with OAuth 2.0
      - Even with all of this robust authentication capability, OpenID Connect is (by design) still compatible with plain OAuth 2.0, making it a very good choice to deploy on top of an OAuth system with minimal developer effort
      - To facilitate the building of good client applications, the OpenID Connect working group has published documents on building a [basic OpenID Connect client](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html) using the authorization code flow as well as building an [implicit OpenID Connect client](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-implicit-1_0.html)
      - Both of these documents walk the developer through building a basic OAuth 2.0 client and adding the handful of components necessary for OpenID Connect.

<!-- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MVVM AND MVP -->

## Difference between MVVM and MVP

- <a href="#mvc-and-mvvm">MVVM</a> uses Data Binding or LiveData to directly update the View, reducing boilerplate code.
  - [Data Binding Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)
    - The View layer can bind data like so: `<TextView android:text="@{viewmodel.userName}" />`
    - This removes the need to call any Java code from the ViewModel layer
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
    - a data holder class that can be observed within a given lifecycle
    - an Observer can be added in a pair with a LifecycleOwner
    - the observer will be notified about modifications of the wrapped data
- MVP (Model-View-Presenter) has a Presenter that manually updates the View using interface callbacks.
  - Model: Handles data and business logic (e.g., API or database interactions).
  - View: Represents the UI (Activity/Fragment) and handles user interactions.
  - Presenter: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It processes user input from the View and fetches data from the Model.
  - see [this](https://medium.com/@manishkumar_75473/understanding-model-view-presenter-mvp-architecture-in-android-a-complete-guide-with-example-fa8e7cecb0e7) in depth explanation
- In **MVVM**, the *ViewModel doesn’t directly reference the View*, ensuring better testability.
- In *MVP*, the *Presenter directly interacts with the View*.

<!-- ROLE OF THE REPOSITORY -->

## Role of the Repository

The Repository **abstracts data sources** (e.g., local database, API). It:

- Provides a *single source of truth*.
- Encapsulates *data operations*.
- Makes it easier to *manage multiple data sources*

See <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm#model">Microsoft's docs on MVVM:</a>
```text
Model classes are typically used in conjunction with services or repositories that encapsulate data access and caching
```

Putting that into perspective: 
```text
| View | -- data binding and commands --> | ViewModel | -- ViewModel updates --> | Model              |
|      | <-- notification --------------- |           | <-- notification ------- | ~~ Repositories ~~ |
```

<!-- SHARED PREFERENCES -->

## Shared Preferences

What are the pros and cons of using SharedPreferences for storing data?

**Pros**:
- Easy to use.
- Suitable for small data (e.g., user preferences).

- **Cons**:
- Not secure for sensitive data.
- Limited to key-value pairs.
  
How can encrypted shared preferences be used to secure data?
Use *EncryptedSharedPreferences* from AndroidX to encrypt data using:
- Master keys stored in the **Android Keystore**.
- **[AES encryption](https://cybernews.com/resources/what-is-aes-encryption/)** for secure storage.

What is Android Keystore, and how is it used to manage sensitive data?
The *Android Keystore System is a secure storage solution that allows apps to store cryptographic keys securely*.

These keys are protected by hardware-backed security in modern devices.

Uses in managing sensitive data:

- Store API keys, tokens, and other sensitive information securely.
- Generate and store encryption keys for encrypting files or shared preferences.
- Protect keys with biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, face ID) or device credentials.
- Using the Keystore ensures that sensitive data is protected even if the app is compromised.

What are the advantages of using DataStore over SharedPreferences?
*DataStore is a newer storage solution for key-value pairs*.

Advantages:

- Uses Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous and non-blocking operations.
- Supports typed data using Proto DataStore.
- More efficient and less prone to data corruption compared to SharedPreferences.

<!-- KOTLIN -->

## Kotlin

What are the main features of Kotlin, and how is it different from Java?
Kotlin Features:

- What is the [difference between **lazy** and **lateinit**](https://medium.com/@guruprasadhegde4/lateinit-and-lazy-property-in-kotlin-8776c67878a0), and how do they affect memory storage? 
    - lazy: *Initializes the property only when accessed for the first time*. Used with *val*.
    - lateinit: The property is initialized later, but *you must initialize it before accessing it*. Used for *var*.

```kotlin
// lazy
val answer: Int by lazy {
    println("Computing the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything")
    42
}

// lateinit
class MyClass {
    lateinit var myVariable: String // will be instantiated later

    fun initializeVariable() {
        myVariable = "Hello, World!" // this will instantiate it
    }

    fun printVariable() {
        if (::myVariable.isInitialized) { // make sure it's been instantiated
            println(myVariable)
        } else {
            println("Variable not initialized")
        }
    }
}
```

- [Null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html):
  - Null safety is a Kotlin feature designed to significantly reduce the risk of null references, also known as [The Billion-Dollar Mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer#History).

```kotlin
// Assigns a non-null string to a variable
var a: String = "abc"
// Attempts to re-assign null to the non-nullable variable
a = null
print(a)
// Null can not be a value of a non-null type String
```
.
- Extension functions.
    - Extension functions *add new functions to existing classes without modifying them*:
    - They enhance readability and reusability.

```kotlin
fun String.isPalindrome(): Boolean {
    return this == this.reversed()
}
```

- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html) for asynchronous programming.
    - To support *efficient concurrency*, Kotlin uses asynchronous programming built around coroutines, which let you write asynchronous code in a natural, sequential style using [suspending functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html#suspending-functions)
    - Coroutines are lightweight *alternatives to threads*

```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    // Root of the coroutine subtree
    coroutineScope { // this: CoroutineScope. This block is the root coroutine of the coroutine subtree
        this.launch {
            this.launch {
                delay(2.seconds)
                println("Child of the enclosing coroutine completed")
            }
            println("Child coroutine 1 completed")
        }
        this.launch {
            delay(1.seconds)
            println("Child coroutine 2 completed")
        }
    }
    // Runs only after all children in the coroutineScope have completed
    println("Coroutine scope completed")
}
```

- [Smart casts](https://medium.com/@arshamjafari85/title-kotlins-smart-casts-unveiling-the-magic-of-type-inference-6a323fbde3a8) and type inference:
  - Smart casts allow the Kotlin compiler to intelligently cast an object to a specific type when certain conditions are satisfied

```kotlin
fun printStringLength(text: Any) {
    if (text is String) {
        println("Length of string: ${text.length}") // Smart cast to String
    } else {
        println("Not a string")
    
```

Differences from Java:

- Kotlin has a more *concise syntax*.
- Offers *better null safety*:
  - Kotlin eliminates null pointer exceptions with:
        - **Nullable Types (?)**: Variables must be explicitly marked nullable (e.g., String?).
        - **Safe Calls (?.)**: Access nullable properties safely without exceptions.
        - **Elvis Operator (?:)**: Provides a default value if a nullable variable is null.
- *Interoperable with Java*.

<!-- SQS CONSUMER FAILURE -->

## SQS Consumer Failure

From the [DOCS](https://github.com/bbc/sqs-consumer)

- Message Acknowledgment Behavior:
  - When `alwaysAcknowledge` is `false` (the default)
    - Returning `undefined`, an `empty object {}`, or an `empty array []`: Message(s) will **NOT** be deleted (left on queue for retry)
  - When `alwaysAcknowledge` is `true`: All messages will be **acknowledged and deleted** regardless of return value.
- Error Handling: Throwing an error (or returning a rejected promise) from the handler function will cause the message to be **left on the queue**. An SQS redrive policy can be used to move messages that cannot be processed to a dead letter queue.
- Deletion Process: Messages are deleted from the queue once the **handler function has completed successfully** (the above items should also be taken into account).

<!-- MULTI TENANT ARCHITECTURE -->

## Multi Tenant Architecture

Clarify the understanding of multi-tenant architecture and how to separate data access between tenants.

Multi-tenant architecture is a design approach that enables multiple user groups — referred to as tenants — access to one instance of an application or system.

Multi-tenant architecture creates distinct, isolated environments within a single physical infrastructure, such as a virtual machine, server, or cloud platform. This is accomplished by partitioning the data storage and processing; providing each tenant with their own dedicated space in the system. A tenant interacts with the application and can access their own data.

Different sets of rules can be applied to each domain in terms of access control, resource allocation, and feature availability.

Poorly implemented multitenancy can lead to issues such as unauthorized access and data misuse. To nullify such threats, these applications require careful design and management to ensure tenant isolation and secure data storage.

The most important thing is to authorize the access of end users. Applications that can be used for this purpose include Okta, Auth0, and Azure Active Directory. Such applications enable organizations to manage authentication, authorization, and identity management capabilities.

See AWS [DOCS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/multi-tenant-architectures-on-aws/)

```text
Tenant data is isolated from access by other tenants in the following ways:
              - the Silo Model separates tenant data into a database instance per tenant;
              - the Bridge Model isolates tenant data into a dedicated schema per tenant;
              - the Pool Model uses the row-level security features of the database engine.
```

<!-- CONCURRENCY -->

## Concurrency

In most scenarios, databases are used concurrently by multiple application instances, each performing modifications to data independently of each other.

When the same data gets modified at the same time, inconsistencies and data corruption can occur.

See [this](https://blog.professorbeekums.com/2021/solving-concurrency-problems/) little blog post.

Two opposite approaches:
- [*optimistic concurrency*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/saving/concurrency?tabs=data-annotations), assumes that concurrency conflicts are relatively rare
  - takes no locks,
  - arranges for the data modification to fail *on save* if the data has changed since it was queried,
  - failure is reported to the application,
  - retry the entire operation on the new data
- *pessimistic approaches*, lock data up-front and only then proceed to modify it.

The "canonical" answer is "no", but that is the answer uninformed people expect. 

As of 2022, NodeJs supports [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html).

In a recent interview, I was told that worker threads should not be used, because of their poor performance. 

Apart from being wrong, NodeJs provides `worker.performance` to monitor performance.

<!-- GLOBALS ARE EVIL -->

## Globals Are Evil

Q: `Why are global and static objects evil? Can you show it with a code example?`

A:
- `Mutable global state is evil for many reasons:`
  - *Bugs from mutable global state* - Mutability can cause a lot of tricky bugs, and makes it difficult to track down where in the codebase they happen. 
  - *Poor testability* - A global mutable state needs to be set up for each test case, limiting the ability to test all scenarios. 
  - *Inflexibility* - A global mutable state supposes that the entire application needs the same shared value at all times. 
  - *Function impurity* - Ideally, all functions should be "pure", i.e. the result depends on the input parameters. A global mutable state presupposes impure functions. 
  - *Code comprehension* - A global mutable state makes it more difficult to understand what a certain bit of code is supposed to do.
  - *Concurrency issues* - A global mutable state requires locking when used in a concurrent situation. This adds complexity to the code.
- `Good alternatives:`
  - *Function parameters* - See `Function impurity` above.
  - *Dependency Injection* - See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3140/10708345) wonderful SO answer, and [this](https://forum.codewithmosh.com/t/what-is-the-difference-between-singleton-and-dependency-injection/11652) discussion on design patterns.
  - *Immutable global state* - This is effectively just "a Constant".
  - *Immutable singletons* - Same as above, but their instantiation can wait till they are needed. 

[Example](https://medium.com/@sitapati/avoiding-mutable-global-state-in-browser-js-89437eaebaac):

*BAD*
```js
// global variable, declared as var, which means that it can be reassigned at runtime
// moreover, the variable's name should convey its global scope, this doesn't
var memArray = [];
//object    
function member(id, password) {
  this.id          = id; 
  this.pwd         = password
}
  
var memObj1 = new member("m001","123");
memArray.push(memObj1);
```

*GOOD*
```js
// Rather than exposing an array, we should expose an object that encapsulates the state, plus mutation methods.
// And we will not expose the actual state, because local functions can still and may be tempted to mutate it directly.
// Instead we will return a copy of the state, so that the only way to update it is via the object methods
const GlobalMemberStore = (() => {
  let _members = []
  const needsArg = arg => {
    if (!arg) {
      throw new Error (`Undefined passed as argument to Store!`)
    }
    return arg
  }
  const needsId = member => {
    if (!member.id) {
      throw new Error (`Undefined id on member passed as argument to Store!`)
    }
    return member
  }
  const Store = {
    // see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Deep_copy
    // because the elements of the array are objects, local functions can still mutate members within the copy,
    // and that will affect the global state — because the array elements are references to objects.
    setMembers: members => (_members = members.map(m => ({...m}))),
    getMembers: () => _members.map(m => ({...m})),
    getMember: id => {
      const member = _members.filter(m => m.id === id)
      return member.length === 1 ? 
        { found: true, member: {...member[0]}} :
        { found: false, member: undefined }

<!-- INVERSION OF CONTROL -->

## Inversion of Control

The *Inversion-of-Control (IoC) pattern*, is about providing any kind of callback, which "implements" and/or controls reaction, instead of acting ourselves directly (in other words, inversion and/or redirecting control to the external handler/controller).
The *Dependency-Injection (DI) pattern* is `a more specific version of IoC pattern`, and is `all about removing direct and/or hard-coded dependencies from your code, to replace them with inject-able dependencies`.

Every DI implementation can be considered IoC, but one should not call it IoC, because implementing Dependency-Injection is harder than callback (Don't lower your product's worth by using the general term "IoC" instead).

For DI example, say your application has a text-editor component, and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this:


```
public class TextEditor {

    private SpellChecker checker;

    public TextEditor() {
        this.checker = new SpellChecker();
    }
}
```

What we've done here creates a dependency between the TextEditor and the SpellChecker. In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this:


```
public class TextEditor {

    private IocSpellChecker checker;

    public TextEditor(IocSpellChecker checker) {
        this.checker = checker;
    }
}
```

In the first code example we are instantiating SpellChecker (this.checker = new SpellChecker();), which means the TextEditor class directly depends on the SpellChecker class.

In the second code example we are creating an abstraction by having the SpellChecker dependency class in TextEditor's constructor signature (not initializing dependency in class). This allows us to call the dependency then pass it to the TextEditor class like so:


```
SpellChecker sc = new SpellChecker(); // dependency
TextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor(sc);
```

Now the client creating the TextEditor class has control over which SpellChecker implementation to use because we're injecting the dependency into the TextEditor signature.

For example, we could inject some improved implementation instead of the default implementation, or, depending on user's needs or settings we could even inject a Spanish spellchecker or German spellchecker.

Note that just like IoC being the base of many other patterns, above sample is only one of many Dependency-Injection kinds, for example:

*Constructor Injection*.

Where an instance of IocSpellChecker would be passed to constructor, either automatically or similar to above manually.

*Setter Injection*.

Where an instance of IocSpellChecker would be passed through setter-method or public property.

*Service-lookup and/or Service-locator*.

Where TextEditor would ask a known provider for a globally-used-instance (service) of IocSpellChecker type (and that maybe without storing said instance, and instead, asking the provider again and again).

[Here](https://github.com/FeelHippo/conversational_commerce/blob/main/inversion_of_control/dependency_injection.js) an example of how to implement lazy injection in vanilla JS.

<!-- LAW OF DEMETER -->

## Law of Demeter

The [Law of Demeter (the Principle of Least Knowledge)](https://dev.to/devcorner/understanding-the-law-of-demeter-in-object-oriented-design-4feg) states that each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units and it should only talk to its immediate friends (sometimes stated as "don't talk to strangers").
Would you write code violating this principle, show why it is a bad design and then fix it?

The Law of Demeter, also known as the Principle of Least Knowledge, is a guideline for reducing coupling between classes. It states:

A method of an object should only call methods of:

- *Itself*
- *Its own fields (member objects)*
- *Objects passed as arguments*
- *Objects created locally within the method*

- In simple terms:
`A class should only interact with objects it directly knows, not objects retrieved from other objects.`

In Low-Level Design (LLD), LoD is crucial because it:

- *Reduces tight coupling between classes*
- *Makes the system easier to maintain*
- *Simplifies unit testing*
- *Encourages encapsulation, hiding internal details from other classes*

*BAD*

Problem:
Driver knows too much about Car’s internals (the Engine).
This creates tight coupling — any change in Car’s engine structure could break Driver.

```
class Engine {
    public void start() { System.out.println("Engine started"); }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine();
    public Engine getEngine() { return engine; }
}

class Driver {
    public void drive(Car car) {
        car.getEngine().start(); // ❌ Violates LoD
    }
}
```

*GOOD*

Benefits:

Driver only interacts with Car, not Engine.
Car encapsulates its Engine internally.
Changes inside Engine do not affect Driver.

```
class Engine {
    public void start() { System.out.println("Engine started"); }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine();
    public void startEngine() { engine.start(); } // LoD-friendly interface
}

class Driver {
    public void drive(Car car) {
        car.startEngine(); // ✅ Only talks to immediate friend
    }
}
```

<!-- ACTIVE RECORD -->

## Active Record

Active-Record is the design pattern that promotes objects to include functions such as Insert, Update, and Delete, and properties that correspond to the columns in some underlying database table.

In your opinion and experience, which are the limits and pitfalls of this pattern?

- [Active Record Pattern vs. Repository Pattern: Making the Right Choice](https://medium.com/@shiiyan/active-record-pattern-vs-repository-pattern-making-the-right-choice-f36d8deece94)
- `Active Record Pattern`
  - it is a software architecture pattern that seamlessly integrates both business logic and data persistence within a single object.
  - This object typically mirrors a row in a relational database management system (RDBMS) table. E.g. a User class, and a row in the Users table
  - With this pattern, when developers instantiate an active record object, they are essentially working directly with a corresponding database row.
  - This direct representation makes it straightforward and intuitive for developers to perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations on the databases, thereby simplifying database interactions.
  - `Flexibility`: 
    - When it comes to the flexibility of managing persistence mechanisms, the active record pattern can present more challenges than the repository pattern.
    - The active record pattern is less modular because the domain model is closely tied to a specific persistence mechanism, such as a relational database or a document-based NoSQL database.
  - `Testability`:
    - Testing domain models in repository pattern is undemanding while testing active record models can be complex.
- `Repository Pattern`
  - Understanding the `Data Mapper Pattern`
    - The data mapper pattern, in contrast to the active record pattern, ensures *domain objects only contain business rules*.
    - Any task related to *database operations is handed over to the data mapper layer*.
    - By separating these concerns, developers can make sure that *changes in one don’t unintentionally impact the other*, leading to more modular, flexible, and maintainable applications.
  - The `Repository Layer`
    - it introduces an additional layer upon the data mapper layer.
    - The main purpose of the repository layer is to centralize the query construction code, providing a more object-oriented way of communicating with a collection of objects.
    - Repositories act as domain object collections. This makes data operations — like adding, removing, or querying objects — feel like you’re simply working with in memory collection-like data structures.
    - By pooling all the query construction code into repositories, the codebase remains DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
    - This centralized approach makes changes to data operation localized, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
- `Active Record Pattern Pitfalls`
  - As complexity grows exponentially, it becomes more challenging to read, understand and debug Active Record Pattern.
  - modifying such a bulky class is risky: with so many functionalities packed into a single place, even minor modifications can lead to unexpected side effects, potentially affecting seemingly unrelated features.
- `Embracing the Repository Pattern and DDD Tactical Design`
  - best to turn to a combination of the Repository pattern and the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) tactical approach
  - By adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), we restructure our codebase to ensure each class does only what it’s supposed to:
    1. *Domain*: encapsulates the core business logic of our application.
    2. *Repository*: This is dedicated to data persistence and retrieval tasks. It abstracts away the details of database operations.
    3. *Events*: used to decouple side-effects (actions performed as consequence of a repository operation) from main operations (the actual repository operation)
    4. *Helpers*: handle side effects, for instance a Notifier

<!-- BILLION DOLLAR MISTAKE -->

## Billion Dollar Mistake

Would you discuss the techniques to avoid the null reference, such as the [Null Object Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/introduce-null-object), or Option types?

- `Null Object Pattern`:
  - Problem: since some methods return null instead of real objects, you have many checks for null in your code.
*BAD*
```javascript
if (customer == null) {
  plan = BillingPlan.basic();
}
else {
  plan = customer.getPlan();
}
```
  - Solution: instead of null, return a null object that exhibits the default behavior.
*GOOD*
```javascript
class NullCustomer extends Customer {
  isNull(): boolean {
    return true;
  }
  getPlan(): Plan {
    return new NullPlan();
  }
  // Some other NULL functionality.
}

// Replace null values with Null-object.
let customer = (order.customer != null) ?
  order.customer : new NullCustomer();

// Use Null-object as if it's normal subclass.
plan = customer.getPlan();
```
  - Drawbacks: the price of getting rid of conditionals is creating yet another new class.
- `Option Type`:
  - Instead of using null or undefined, you use a special type that represents two distinct states:
    - `Some`: A value is present, and it's wrapped in this variant.
    - `None`: There is no value, represented explicitly by this variant.
  - This pattern ensures that you must handle both cases explicitly, thereby enhancing type safety and code clarity
  - When you have a variable of type Option<T>, TypeScript knows it could be one of these two variants.
  - This promotes a conscious and explicit handling of the "absence" case, something that using null or undefined doesn't enforce.
*GOOD*
```typescript
type Some<T> = {
  _tag: "Some",
  value: T
}

type None = {
  _tag: "None"
}

<!-- INHERITANCE VS COMPOSITION -->

## Inheritance vs Composition

[Many state that](https://hackernoon.com/inheritance-vs-composition-in-javascript), in Object-Oriented Programming, composition is often a better option than inheritance. What's you opinion?

- `Inheritance`: it is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming, it helps avoiding code duplication.
  - The main idea is that we create a base class, which contains logic, that will be reused by our subclasses.
```typescript
class Super {
    create() {}
    remove() {}
}

// SubClass "is-a" Super
class SubClass extends Super {
    // create, remove, etc are available
}
```
- `Composition`: uses a has-a relationship. We collect different pieces of functionality together.

```typescript
class Super {
    constructor(subClass, anotherSubClass) {
        // Super "has-a" SubClass
        this.subClass = subclass;
        this.anotherSubClass = anotherSubClass;
    }
    
    // example
    doSomething() {
        var httpResponse = this.anotherSubClass.get();
        this.subClass.writeFileSystem(httpResponse);
    }
}

class SubClass {
    constructor(type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
    writeFileSystem() {}
}

class AnotherSubClass {
    constructor(type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
    httpCall() {}
}
```
- `Why prefer Composition over Inheritance?`:
  - see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14633709/10708345) wonderful SO answer, for pros and cons
  - most languages, including JS, do not allow multiple inheritance
  - it scales better than inheritance
  - it provides better abstraction and encapsulation, better code reuse
  - it makes it easier to uphold the "Single Responsibility Principle"
    - which is often summarized as "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."
    - it means that every class exists for a specific purpose and it should only have methods that are directly related to its purpose.

<!-- ANTI CORRUPTION LAYER -->

## Anti Corruption Layer

What is an Anti-corruption Layer?

- Microsoft [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/anti-corruption-layer)
- Isolate the different subsystems by placing an anti-corruption layer between them.
- This layer translates communications between the two systems, allowing one system to remain unchanged while the other can avoid compromising its design and technological approach.

<!-- SINGLETON -->

## Singleton

Singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single object. Writing a Thread-Safe Singleton class is not so obvious. Would you try?

[This](https://medium.com/@cancerian0684/singleton-design-pattern-and-how-to-make-it-thread-safe-b207c0e7e368) solution is perfect in a Java environment. This scenario will hardly happen in a NodeJs environment, since by default NodeJs is single thread.

<!-- DATA ABSTRACTION -->

## Data Abstraction

The ability to change implementation without affecting clients is called [Data Abstraction](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/12oop/). Produce an example violating this property, then fix it.

- A client does not need to know how a data type is implemented in order to be able to use it.
- *Creating objects* - Each data-type value is stored in an object. To create (or instantiate) an individual object, we invoke a constructor by using the keyword new.
  - Each time that a client uses new, the system allocates memory space for the object, initializes its value, and returns a reference to the object.
- *Invoking instance methods* - The purpose of an instance method is to operate on data-type values.
  - Instance methods have all of the properties of static methods:
    - arguments are passed by value,
    - method names can be overloaded,
    - they may have a return value, 
    - they may cause side effects. 
  - They have an additional property that characterizes them: *each invocation is associated with an object*.
- *Using objects* - Declarations give us variable names for objects that we can use in code. To use a given data type, we:
  - Declare variables of the type, for use in referring to objects
  - Use the keyword new to invoke a constructor that creates objects of the type
  - Use the object name to invoke instance methods, either as statements or within expressions

*BAD*
```dart
//concrete class
class Car {
  const Car({ required this.brand });
  final String brand;
  void accelerate() {
    print('$brand -> accelerate');
  }
}

void main() {
  Car suzuki = new Car(brand: 'Suzuki');
  suzuki.accelerate();
}

```

*GOOD*
```dart
// abstract class
abstract class Car {  
    void accelerate();  
}  
// concrete class
class Suzuki extends Car{  
    void accelerate(){
        print('Suzuki -> accelerate');
     
    }
}

<!-- DEPENDENCY HELL -->

## Dependency Hell

How would you deal with [Dependency Hell](https://webflow.sourcegraph.com/blog/nine-circles-of-dependency-hell)?

- Make sure you’re running a check against dependencies' version in your presubmit. Before the pull request is merged is also a great time to vet new dependencies — for licenses or security issues
- Sometimes a little duplication is better than a bit of dependency.
- Instead of eating more dependencies, try to snack on the low-hanging fruit of removing unused dependencies
- Use a single package manager. Use declarative tools to glue everything else together
- Tools like Docker can help capture all of these in one place, all in a mostly reproducible manner.
- If you can, point to a specific github tag
- Avoid monkey patching. If you must, use a third_party directory.
- consider using interfaces, contracts, or dependency injection to provide loose coupling across different packages.

<!-- ROBUSTNESS PRINCIPLE -->

## Robustness Principle

The [robustness principle](https://medium.com/@mesw1/understanding-the-robustness-principle-postels-law-c1199ea79210) is a general design guideline for software that recommends "be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept".
It is often reworded as "be a tolerant reader and a careful writer". Would you like to discuss the rationale of this principle?

*Examples and Impact*
- *GOOD*
  - *Enhanced Robustness*: Systems that can interpret and process a wide range of input formats are more resilient to unexpected data, reducing the likelihood of crashes or failures.
- *BAD*
  - *Security Risks*: Accepting a broad spectrum of inputs can lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.
  - *Protocol Rigidity*: Over time, being too liberal with accepted inputs can make it challenging to update or evolve protocols, as newer implementations might rely on this flexibility.

- *Implementing Postel’s Law: A Balanced Approach*
    - *Strict Output Standards*: Ensure that the data your system outputs rigorously follows established protocols and standards.
    - *Flexible Input Processing*: Develop mechanisms to handle a variety of inputs gracefully. This includes implementing security checks and validations to guard against potential exploits.
    - *Continuous Monitoring and Updates*: Regularly update your system to address any emerging vulnerabilities, especially those arising from the liberal acceptance of inputs.

*Summary: The Significance of Balance*

The Robustness Principle, while fostering system resilience and flexibility, must be applied with a careful balance.
Overemphasis on either aspect — be it the conservative output or liberal input acceptance — can lead to challenges,
including security vulnerabilities and resistance to protocol evolution. As software engineers,
especially in fields impacting humanity like medical device development,
it’s crucial to implement Postel’s Law judiciously,
ensuring our systems are both robust and secure.

<!-- SEPARATION OF CONCERNS -->

## Separation of Concerns

[Separation of Concerns](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/separation-of-concerns-soc/) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct areas, each one addressing a separate concern. There are a lot of different mechanisms for achieving Separation of Concerns (use of objects, functions, modules, or patterns such as MVC and the like). Would you discuss this topic?

Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a fundamental principle in software engineering and design aimed at breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts. The goal is to organize a system's components in a way that each part addresses a single concern, or a cohesive aspect of functionality, rather than mixing multiple concerns together. This approach enhances modularity, maintainability, and scalability of software systems.

Concerns might include user interface presentation, data storage and retrieval, business logic processing, error handling, security, etc. Each concern represents a cohesive aspect that can be managed independently.

Separation of Concerns (SoC) is important in software engineering for several reasons:
- *Modularity* - SoC encourages breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts,
- *Maintainability* - changes and updates to one aspect of the system are less likely to impact other parts,
- *Scalability* - Modularity promotes a design that allows for easy scalability,
- *Reusability* - Separating concerns often leads to the creation of reusable components,
- *Parallel Development* - SoC facilitates parallel development by providing clear boundaries between different parts of the system,
- *Understanding and Debugging* - With concerns separated into distinct modules, it becomes easier to understand and debug software systems.

Here's how SoC can be applied to system design:
- *Layered Architecture* - Divide the system into layers, each responsible for a specific concern or aspect of functionality,
- *Microservices Architecture* - Decompose the system into smaller, independent services, each responsible for a specific business function or domain,
- *Component-Based Design* - Design the system as a collection of reusable, self-contained components, each addressing a specific concern,
- *Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)* - Organize the system into loosely coupled, interoperable services that communicate through standardized interfaces,
- *Clear Interfaces and Contracts* - Define clear interfaces and contracts between different components or layers of the system,
- *Domain-Driven Design (DDD)* - Identify and model the core domains and business concerns of the system.

<!-- HIGH COHESION LOOSE COUPLING -->

## High Cohesion, Loose Coupling

It is often said that one of the most important goals in Object-Oriented Design (and code design in general) is to have High Cohesion and Loose Coupling. 

What does it mean? Why is it that important and how is it achieved?

From [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74189337/10708345) wonderful SO answer:

![See it here](https://i.sstatic.net/n2dIU.png)

- *Cohesion* is a measure of the number of relationships that parts of a component have with each other. High cohesion means that all parts that are needed to deliver the component's functionality are included in the component

- *Coupling* is a measure of the number of relationships that one component has with other components in the system. Low coupling means that components do not have many relationships with other components

<!-- INDEX ZERO -->

## Index Zero

Q: `Why do array indexes start with '0' in most languages?`

A: I don't think any of us can provide a stronger argument than Edsger W. Dijkstra's article ["Why numbering should start at zero"](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html).

```text
When dealing with a sequence of length N, the elements of which we wish to distinguish by subscript,
the next vexing question is what subscript value to assign to its starting element.

Adhering to convention a) (i.e 2 ≤ i < 13) yields, when starting with subscript 1, the subscript range 1 ≤ i < N+1; 

e.g. N == 5
1 ≤ i < 6

starting with 0, however, gives the nicer range 0 ≤  i < N. 

e.g. N == 5
0 ≤ i < 5

So let us let our ordinals start at zero: an element's ordinal (subscript) equals the number of elements preceding it in the sequence.
And the moral of the story is that we had better regard —after all those centuries!— zero as a most natural number.

Almost any test has the capability of providing helpful design cues about the subject it directly interacts with. 
To make the most of that capability requires a keen awareness by the developer of the level of coupling they're aiming for 
in their test and the implications of that coupling on the design and malleability of their code.

<!-- MULTIPLE INHERITANCE -->

## Multiple Inheritance

Neither Typescript nor Dart support multiple "implementation" inheritance. They do, however, support multiple interfaces.

For implementation, there is only a single super-class chain that a class can inherit member implementations from.

*Typescript* gives us a [wonderful pattern](https://blog.bitsrc.io/multiple-inheritance-or-typescript-mixins-10076c4f136a) allowing us to create the function that will extend a base class.

- define the type `Constructor` and interfaces that classes A and C implement:
```typescript
type Constructor<T = any> = new (...args: any[]) => T;

interface HasMethodA {
  propA: number;
  a(): void;
}

interface HasMethodC {
  c(): void;
}
```

- create a mixin function for class A:
```typescript
function mixinA<T extends Constructor>(base: T): Constructor<HasMethodA> & T {
  return class extends base {
    protected _propA: number;

    get propA(): number {
      return this._propA;
    }

    constructor(...args: any[]) {
      super(...args);
    }

    a(): void {
      console.log('Method "a"');
      this._propA = 42;
    }
  };
}
```

- create mixin for class C:
````typescript
function mixinC<T extends Constructor>(base: T): Constructor<HasMethodC> & T {
  return class extends base {
    constructor(...args: any[]) {
      super(...args);
    }

    c(): void {
      console.log('Method "c"');
    }
  };
}
````

- construct our resulting class D:
```typescript
const Dbase = mixinC(mixinA(class {}));

class D extends Dbase {}

const d = new D();
d.a();
d.c();
console.log(d.propA);
```

*Dart* does have mixins, which allows implementation to be used by multiple classes, but not through inheritance as much as by mixin application.

```dart
abstract class A {
  String get foo;
}
class A1 implements A {
  String get foo => "A1";
}
class A2 implements A {
  String get foo => "A2";
}
mixin B on A {
  String get foo => "B:${super.foo}";
}
class C extends A1 with B {
  String get foo => "C:${super.foo}";
}
class D extends A2 with B {
  String get foo => "D:${super.foo}";
}
void main() {
  print(C().foo); // C:B:A1
  print(D().foo); // D:B:A2
}

<!-- DOMAIN LOGIC IN STORED PROCEDURES -->

## Domain Logic in Stored Procedures

What are the pros and cons of holding domain logic in Stored Procedures?

A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

In your opinion, why has Object-Oriented Design dominated the market for so many years?

See [this](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/09/02/if-everyone-hates-it-why-is-oop-still-so-widely-spread/) wonderful SO article. 

```text
OOP is still one of the dominant paradigms right now. But that might be due to the success of languages who happen to be OOP. 

Java, C++ and Kotlin rule mobile for Android and Swift and Objective-C for iOS so you can’t develop software for mobile unless you understand the object-oriented approach. 

For the web, it’s JavaScript, Python, PHP and Ruby.

Asking why so many widely-used languages are OOP might be mixing up cause and effect. 

Richard Feldman argues in his talk that it might just be coincidence. 

C++ was developed in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup, initially as a set of extensions to the C programming language. 

Building on C , C++ added object orientation but Feldman argues it became popular for the overall upgrade from C including type-safety and added support for automatic resource management, 
generic programming, and exception handling, among other features.

Then Java wanted to appeal to C++ programmers and doubled down on the OOP part. 

Ultimately, Sun Microsystems wanted to repeat the C++ trick by aiming for greatest familiarity for developers adopting Java.

Millions of developers quickly moved to Java due to its exclusive integration in web browsers at the time. 

Seen this way, OOP seems to just be hitching a ride, rather than driving the success.

<!-- BAD DESIGN -->

## Bad Design

What would you do to understand if your code has a bad design?

See [this](https://medium.com/globant/characteristics-of-a-poor-software-design-de71e7b7a73c) interesting article from Medium

```text
- Breaking of one functionality during development of another one.
- Existing code not supporting future enhancements.
- Complexity in understanding and maintaining the code.
- Difficult to test feature in isolation
- Difficult to add new features
```

According to Robert C. Martin, there are 4 important characteristics of a bad design:
- Rigidity: when a change in a class requires changes in some other coupled classes.
- Immobility: when certain components cannot be reused and are not generic enough. 
- Fragility: when a change somewhere in the codebase breaks something else where. 
- Viscosity: when it's easier to come up with a hack rather than good code (not rigid, not immobile, and not fragile).

<!-- 3 WORST DEFECTS -->

## 3 Worst Defects

Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.

It can compile to machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly.

It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics and type inference.

- It's verbose.
  - See `null safety` [here](https://dart.dev/null-safety), lots to consider and additional syntax to deal with it.

```dart
void main() {
    // Unless you tell Dart that a variable can have a null value, it is non-nullable.
      String name = null; // not allowed, compiler will complain
      String? lastname = null; // OK, but from this point on you are in charge of double checking
    
      if (lastName != null && lastName.isNotEmpty) {
        // you can now use your variable
        String nonNullLastName = lastname;
      }
    
    // assertion operator !
      String nonNullLastName = lastname!; // You force the compiler to think the variable is not null. Common source of bugs
    
    // All the non-nullable variables must be initialized after their declaration.
    // To counter this issue the late keyword is used. It allows lazy initializing a variable.
    // However, it is then the Developer's job to ensure that it is initialized before it is used.
      late String lateLastName; // not assigned yet, the compiler trusts you!
      lateLastName = "Smith";
      print(lateLastName); // all good
    
    // additional operators
    
    // conditional member access
      late SomeObject? object;
      int? someObjectValue = object?.someValue; // will obtain the value only if it's NOT null
    
    // if null
      int actualValue = someObjectValue ?? 0; // if value is null, by default return 0
}
```
  - Instead of [sum types](https://medium.com/axon-insights/mastering-sum-types-b588a3bc165b), it encourages [class hierarchy](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.j.p.heck/Courses/JAVAcourse/ch3/s1.html). See <a href="#inheritance-vs-composition">Inheritance</a>.

```typescript
// Typescript provides sum types
type Value = string | number

const a: Value = 'John'
const b: Value = 70
const c: Value = false // Won't compile

function program(a: Value) {
    if (typeof a === 'string') {
        // In this conditional block the type of `a` is `string`
        a.toUpperCase()
    } else {
        // In this conditional block the type of `a` is `number`
        a.toExponential()

        // Won't compile because there's no such property on the `number` type
        a.toUpperCase()
    }
}
```

  - See how to equate objects (override `==``):

```dart
class Person {
  const Person(this.name);

  final String name;

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =>
      identical(this, other) ||
          other is Person &&
              runtimeType == other.runtimeType &&
              name == other.name;

  @override
  int get hashCode => name.hashCode;
}

See [this](https://gist.github.com/donnut/fd56232da58d25ceecf1) explanation and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36321/10708345) SO answer.

In functional programming you often want to apply a function partly. 

Currying is when you break down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take only one argument.

*BEFORE*
```javascript

    return a + b;
}

add(3, 4); // returns 7
```

}

// usage
add(3)(4); // returns 7

<!-- GENERICS -->

## Generics

What are generics useful for?

See this item from Oracle [DOCS](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/why.html)

In a nutshell, generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods. Much like the more familiar formal parameters used in method declarations, type parameters provide a way for you to re-use the same code with different inputs. The difference is that the inputs to formal parameters are values, while the inputs to type parameters are types.

Benefits@
- Stronger type checks at compile time
- Elimination of casts

```dart
void main() {
  List<String> list = <String>['a', 'b'];
  list.add("hello");
  String s = list.last; // no cast
  print(s);
}
```

```typescript
function identity<Type>(...args: Type[]): Type {
    return args[0];

  while (counter < 100) {
    print(counter);
    counter++;
  }
  print('Done');
}
// recursive
void main() {
  recursiveCounter();
  print('Done');
}

void recursiveCounter({ int counter = 0 }) {
  if (counter == 100) return;
  print(counter);
  return recursiveCounter(counter: counter + 1);
}
```

In my opinion, unless performance and memory optimization are an issue, loop vs recursion is a matter of personal preference. 
However, loops tend to be better maintainable, easy to ready and scale better, as instructions are executed sequentially.
Recursive functions are more memory intensive, as they are queued in a stack, and executed LIFO.

<!-- FUNCTIONS AS FIRST CLASS CITIZENS -->

## Functions as First Class Citizens

What does it mean when a language treats functions as first-class citizens? Why is it important that in a language functions are first-class citizens?

See Mozilla's [DOCS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function)

```text
A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.
For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.
```

It is important because it makes HOF possible.

<!-- ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS -->

## Anonymous Functions

Show me an example where an anonymous function can be useful.

```text
An anonymous function is simply a function that does not have a name. Unlike named functions,
which are declared with a name for easy reference, anonymous functions are usually created for specific tasks and are often assigned to variables or used as arguments for other functions.
```

```javascript
// example: CLOSURE
function private(personalSecret) {
    // the return function has access to 'personalSecret' because they are both witin the scope of 'private'
    return () => console.log(personalSecret);
}

console.log(private) // ==> ƒ private(personalSecret) { return () => console.log(personalSecret); }

const mySecret = private('I have garlic for breakfast'); // create an instance of 'private' with a value that will 'live' within the function
console.log(mySecret) // ==> () => console.log(personalSecret)

// we can now fire the inner function with the value assigned at line 39
mySecret()

<!-- STATIC AND DYNAMIC TYPING -->

## Static and Dynamic Typing

There are a lot of different type systems. Let's talk about static and dynamic type systems, and about strong and weak ones. 

You surely have an opinion and a preference about this topic. 

Would you like to share them, and discuss why and when would you promote one particular type system for developing an enterprise software?

See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1517670/10708345) wonderful SO answer.

*STATIC*
```text
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. 

For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is:

final List<SomeMap> myMap = <SomeMap>[];

Other languages  offer some form of type inference, the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable :

final name = 'Filippo'; // name.runtimeType is String

The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.

(e.g.: OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin, Java, C, C++, Dart)
```

*DYNAMIC*
```text
A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. 

This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time

(e.g.: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang)

<!-- HATE OF JAVA -->

## Hate of Java

Why do many software engineers not like Java?

Many software engineers have mixed feelings about Java for several reasons:

- *Verbosity*: Java requires more boilerplate code compared to more concise languages like Python or JavaScript, which can lead to longer development times and increased maintenance efforts.
- *Performance*: Java can be slower than languages like C or C++ due to its reliance on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and garbage collection. This can be a concern for high-performance applications.
- *Memory Consumption*: Java applications tend to consume more memory than applications written in languages that compile directly to native code, which can be a drawback for resource-constrained environments.
- *Learning Curve*: For beginners, the learning curve can be steep due to its strict object-oriented principles and the need to understand concepts like interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- *Ecosystem and Frameworks*: While Java has a rich ecosystem, some engineers feel that the frameworks and libraries can be overly complex or outdated. This can lead to frustration when trying to implement modern features or patterns.
- *Concurrency Model*: Java's concurrency model, while powerful, can be complex and lead to issues like deadlocks if not managed carefully. Some developers prefer languages with simpler concurrency models.
- *Legacy Code*: Many enterprises have large amounts of legacy Java code that can be difficult to maintain or modernize.

Despite these criticisms, it's worth noting that Java remains one of the most widely used programming languages, especially in enterprise environments, due to its stability, portability, and large community support.

<!-- GOOD AND BAD LANGUAGES -->

## Good and Bad Languages

What makes a good language good and a bad language bad?

In my opinion, this is a very subjective matter. Hence, I will refer to the latest SO survey to answer this:

- [Here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology) you will find the results
- the most loved programming languages (with related characteristics) are:
  - JS: see [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-javascript/)
  - Python: see [this](https://serokell.io/blog/python-pros-and-cons)
  - TS: see [this](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/typescript-pros-and-cons/)
  - Java: see <a href="#hate-of-java">this</a>
  - C#: see [this](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/c-sharp-pros-and-cons/)
  - C++: see [this](https://pangea.ai/resources/a-comprehensive-guide-to-c-advantages-and-disadvantages)
  - PHP: see [this](https://www.naukri.com/code360/library/pros-and-cons-of-php-programming)

  - Golang: see [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-pros-cons-go-golang-programming-language-indra-nand-jha/)

Conversely, some programming languages are frequently cited as the most hated due to their limitations or outdated nature. Zephyr, Prolog, Apex, Fortran, Nim, Delphi, Ada, Objective-C, VBA, and Perl are among the least loved, often due to niche use cases, steep learning curves, limited modern support, or complex syntax.

<!-- REFERENTIAL TRANSPARENCY -->

## Referential Transparency

Write two functions, one referentially transparent and the other one referentially opaque. Discuss.

See [this](https://medium.com/@linz07m/how-referential-transparency-helps-you-write-safer-code-98f8b1a4875f) cool blog on functional programming.

- An expression is *referentially transparent* if it can be *replaced with its resulting value without affecting the program’s behavior*.
- This property ensures that *evaluating an expression always produces the same result, given the same input*.
- *Pure functions* always return the same output for a given input without causing side effects. This makes them referentially transparent.

```typescript
const double = (n: number): number => n * 2;

const x = double(2);
const y = double(2);

// double(2) always evaluates to 4. Since we can replace double(2) with 4 directly, the function is referentially transparent.
// We can safely refactor the code as follows:

const x = 4;
const y = x;
```

- Why is Referential Transparency Important?
  - *Simplifies Reasoning*: Code is easier to understand because expressions behave predictably without requiring external context.
  - *Safe Refactoring*: Code can be modified without worrying about unintended side effects, reducing bugs.

<!-- STACK AND HEAP -->

## Stack and Heap

What is a stack and what is a heap? What's a stack overflow?

See [this](https://www.programmerinterview.com/data-structures/difference-between-stack-and-heap/) wonderful article. 

- They are both stored in the computer’s RAM (Random Access Memory)
- In a multi-threaded application, each thread will have its own stack. But, all the different threads will share the heap
- an object can be stored on the stack. If you create an object inside a function without using the “new” operator then this will create and store the object on the stack, and not on the heap
  -  in this case, the object is destroyed once the function has run to completion
- Once a function call runs to completion, any data on the stack created specifically for that function call will automatically be deleted.
  - Any data on the heap will remain there until it’s manually deleted by the programmer.
- The stack is set to a *fixed size*, and can not grow past that. 
  - if there is not enough room on the stack to handle the memory being assigned to it, a *stack overflow occurs*.
  - This often happens when a lot of nested functions are being called, or if there is an infinite recursive call.
- If the current size of the heap is too small to accommodate new memory, then more memory can be added to the heap by the operating system.
  - This is one of the big differences between the heap and the stack.

<!-- PATTERN MATCHING -->

## Pattern Matching

Some languages, especially the ones that promote a functional approach, allow a technique called pattern matching.

Do you know it? How is pattern matching different from switch clauses?

- See [Oracle's](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/pattern-matching.html) docs:
  - Pattern matching involves testing whether an object has a particular structure, then extracting data from that object if there's a match.
  - Not to be confused with a simple `switch` or `when`, because the [patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching) generally have the form of either `sequences or tree structures`
- Pattern Matching is generally not possible in js/ts
- see [this](https://dev.to/gvergnaud/bringing-pattern-matching-to-typescript-introducing-ts-pattern-v3-0-o1k) article for more info
  - pattern matching is achieved in TS by use of a library, it's not native to the language itself
- Kotlin's [when clause](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/control-flow.html#when-expressions-and-statements) is close to pattern matching
  - see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/16r01kr/comment/k20b70f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to learn why it actually is not pattern matching:
    - when is limited to:
      - comparing for equality against another value (usually a literal) `==`
      - checking the class of an object `is`
      - checking for containment within a container `contains()`
    - hence, no patterns for `sequences or tree structures`

<!-- EXCEPTIONS -->

## Exceptions

Why do some languages have no exceptions by design? What are the pros and cons?

- See [this](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/258043) wonderful answer
- Exceptions can make code more difficult to reason
  - in many cases code that uses exceptions would look just as complex as code that didn't, because of the extra cleanup required
- Exceptions can be emulated with a sufficiently powerful type system
  - modern type systems usually make it more elegant and also harder to forget to handle the error condition

<!-- CONSTRUCTORS AND INTERFACES -->

## Constructors and Interfaces

In Java, C# and many other languages, why are constructors not part of the interface?

- **Interfaces** in Java are used for *defining a contract that classes can implement*
- A **Constructor** is to *initialize the non-static members* of a particular class with respect to an object.
- An **Interface** in Java doesn't have a constructor because *all data members in interfaces are public static final by default*, they are constants (assign the values at the time of declaration)

```typescript
interface Addition {
   add: (x: int, y: int) => int; // public static
}
class Test implements Addition {
   add(x: int, y: int) {
      return x + y;
   }
}
```

- An abstract class can have a constructor because it can be instantiated indirectly through its subclasses
  - See [Constructors in Dart – Use Cases and Examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/constructors-in-dart/). 

```dart
abstract class Animal {
  const Animal({String species = 'cat'}) : _species = species;

  final String _species;

  String get species => _species;
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  const Cat({String species = 'cat', String breed = 'siamese'})
      : _breed = breed,
        super(species: species); // Animal instantiated indirectly through Cat

  final String _breed;

  String get breed => _breed;
}

<!-- API VERSIONING -->

## API Versioning

How would you manage Web Services API versioning?

APIs only need to be up-versioned when a breaking change is made.

Breaking changes include:
- a change in the format of the response data for one or more calls
- a change in the request or response type (i.e. changing an integer to a float)
- removing any part of the API.

REST doesn’t provide for any specific versioning guidelines, but the more commonly used approaches fall into three categories:
- URI Versioning
  - it does violate the principle that a URI should refer to a unique resource
  - it breaks client integration when a version is updated
  - examples: `http://api.example.com/v1/users` => `http://api.example.com/v2/users
- Versioning using Custom Request Header
  - A custom header (e.g. `Accept-version`) allows you to preserve your URIs between versions
  - however, it is effectively a duplicate of the content negotiation behavior implemented by the existing Accept header (below).
  - examples: `{ headers: { Accept-Version: v1, X-API-Version: 1 } }` => `{ headers: { Accept-Version: v2, X-API-Version: 2 } }`
- Versioning using “Accept” header
  - Content negotiation allows to preserve a clean set of URLs
  - however, the API should deal with the complexity of serving different versions of content somewhere (usually the Controllers)
  - The result tends to be a more complex API as clients have to know which headers to specify before requesting a resource
  - examples: `{ headers: { Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json } }` => `{ headers: { Accept: application/vnd.example.v2+json } }`

<!-- REST VS SOAP -->

## REST vs SOAP

REST and SOAP: when would you choose one, and when the other?

See [AWS DOCS](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-soap-rest/)

```text 
When to use SOAP vs REST?
Before choosing between SOAP and REST, consider your scenarios and your API users' requirements. The following criteria are worth considering.

Overall application design
Modern applications like mobile apps and hybrid applications work better with REST APIs. REST gives you the scalability and flexibility to design applications using modern architecture patterns like microservices and containers. However, if you need to integrate or extend legacy systems that already have SOAP APIs, you may be better off continuing with SOAP.

Security
Public APIs have lower security requirements and demand greater flexibility so anyone can interact with them. So, REST is a better choice when you build public APIs. Conversely, some private APIs for internal enterprise requirements (like data reporting for compliance) may benefit from the tighter security measures in WS-Security of SOAP.

ACID compliance
Do your API users require stringent consistency and data integrity across a chain of transactions? For instance, finance transactions require an entire batch of data updates to fail if even one update fails.

SOAP has built-in compliance for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID). And SOAP may be better suited for high data integrity requirements. In this case, REST APIs may require additional software modules to enforce the state at the server or database level.

<!-- NULL IS SPECIAL -->

## NULL is special

Why do databases treat null as a so special case?
For example, why does SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = null not match records with null field in SQL?

[NULL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_(SQL)) represents *missing information and inapplicable information*.
In SQL, null is a *marker, not a value*. This explains why SELECT cannot filter by NULL, as it expects a **value**. 
This usage is quite different from most programming languages, where a null value of a reference means it is not pointing to any object.

<!-- SCHEMA MIGRATIONS -->

## Schema Migrations

How would you manage database [schema migrations](https://www.liquibase.com/resources/guides/database-schema-migration)? 
That is, how would you automate changes to database schema, as the application evolves, version after version?

Database schema migration is the process of managing and applying changes to a database’s structural framework or schema. 
Sometimes referred to as simply “database migrations,” they allow the schema to evolve alongside the application.

This often involves tasks such as adding or removing tables, columns, or indexes, as well as modifying data types or constraints. 
Executed correctly, these migrations ensure data integrity, consistency, and optimal database performance throughout the software development life cycle.

Schema migrations align more closely with DevOps practices and make for faster, more productive teams.

To answer the question, schema migration is preferred over **state-based deployments**.

State-based deployment methods **compare the current state of a database to its ideal state to find necessary changes**. 
With a schema migration-based deployment approach, **changes are instead described by the user alongside development and applied iteratively**. 

This allows for benefits including:

- Small, incremental changes
- Consistent processes for all code delivery
- Fast feedback loops
- Granular feature control
- Better [DB testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_testing)
- Mitigation of [database drift](https://www.bytebase.com/blog/what-is-database-schema-drift/)

<!-- LAZY LOADING -->

## Lazy Loading

How is lazy loading achieved? When is it useful? What are its pitfalls?

See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36297/10708345) wonderful SO answer:

```text
It's called lazy loading because, like a lazy person, you are putting off doing something you don't want to.
The opposite is Eager Loading, where you load something right away, long before you need it.

If you are curious why people might use lazy loading, consider an application that takes a LOOOOONG time to start.
This application is probably doing a lot of eager loading... loading things from disk, and doing calculations and whatnot long before it is ever needed.

Compare this to lazy loading, the application would start much faster, but then the first time you need to do something that requires some long running load, 
there may be a slight pause while it is loaded for the first time. 

Thus, with lazy loading, you are amortizing the load time throughout the course of running your application...
and you may actually save from loading things that the user may never intend to use.
```

<!-- N+1 PROBLEM -->

## N+1 Problem

The so called "N + 1 problem" is an issue that occurs when code needs to load the children of a parent-child relationship with a ORMs that have lazy-loading enabled,
and that therefore issue a query for the parent record, and then one query for each child record. How to fix it?

[Let's say](https://stackoverflow.com/a/97253/10708345) you have a collection of Car objects (database rows), and each Car has a collection of Wheel objects (also rows).
In other words, Car → Wheel is a 1-to-many relationship.

Now, let's say you need to iterate through all the cars, and for each one, print out a list of the wheels. The naive O/R implementation would do the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Cars;
```

And then for each Car:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Wheel WHERE CarId = ?
```

In other words, you have one select for the Cars, and then N additional selects, where N is the total number of cars.

Alternatively, one could get all wheels and perform the lookups in memory:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Wheel;
```

This reduces the number of round-trips to the database from N+1 to 2.
Most ORM tools give you several ways to prevent N+1 selects.

<!-- SLOWEST QUERIES -->

## Slowest Queries

How would you find the most expensive queries in an application?

SQL servers provide **Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)**.

The *sys.dm_exec_requests* and *sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks* views provide valuable information about what each query is waiting for and how long it has been in that state.

```sql
SELECT 
    r.session_id, 
    r.status, 
    r.wait_type, 
    r.wait_time, 
    r.blocking_session_id,
    st.text AS QueryText
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_requests AS r
CROSS APPLY 
    sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) AS st
WHERE 
    r.wait_type IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    r.wait_time DESC;
```

<!-- NORMALIZATION -->

## Normalization

In your opinion, is it always needed to use database normalization? When is it advisable to use denormalized databases?

[See](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DSnAKE87qgB73S30PIILxbvZwSjLTTf3/view?usp=drive_link)
- see the first 3.5 Normalized Forms in the slides

Normalization *avoids storing redundant data*, as this can lead to "anomalies" when inserting/updating/deleting data.

- use cases:
    - *OLTP* online transactional processing -> uses *normalised* data
    - *OLAP* online analytical processing -> uses *denormalized* data for *data warehouses* etc (star schema, OLAP cubes)

Hence, denormalized data can be used for *analytical purposes*.

<!-- BLUE GREEN DEPLOYMENT -->

## Blue/Green Deployment

One of the Continuous Integration's techniques is called Blue-Green Deployment:
it consists in having two production environments, as identical as possible, and in performing the deployment in one of them while the other one is still operating, 
and then in safely switching the traffic to the second one after some convenient testing. 
This technique becomes more complicated when the deployment includes changes to the database structure or content. 
I'd like to discuss this topic with you.

[See](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/blue-green-deployments/best-practices-for-managing-data-synchronization-and-schema-changes.html).

```text
Both the blue and green environments need up-to-date data:

- The green environment needs up-to-date data access because it’s becoming the new production environment.

- The blue environment needs up-to-date data in the event of a rollback, when production is either shifts back or remains on the blue environment.

Broadly, you accomplish this by having both the green and blue environments share the same data stores.

Structured data stores, such as relational database management systems (RDBMS),
where the data schema can diverge between the environments, typically require additional considerations:

A general recommendation is to decouple schema changes from the code changes:

- The schema is changed first, before the blue/green code deployment.
  - Database updates must be backward compatible, so the old version of the application can still interact with the data.
  - "additive approach": you can add fields to tables, new entities, and relationships

- The schema is changed last, after the blue/green code deployment.
  - Code changes in the new version of the application must be backward compatible with the old schema.
  - "deletive approach": you can remove unneeded fields, entities, and relationships, or merge and consolidate them. 
  - After this removal, the earlier application version is no longer operational.
```
